- **Minimalist Design**: The landing page is designed with simplicity in mind, with a focus on clear messaging and a clean layout.
- **Smooth Scroll**: Smooth scrolling functionality for better user navigation between sections.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content and layout of the landing page.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for fine-tuning the design and enhancing the Bootstrap 4 components.

## Structure

The landing page is divided into several sections:

- **Footer Section**: Contains links to additional resources and contact information.
